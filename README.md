## Threshold Spectral Community Detection for NetworkX


NetworkX Community detection based on the algorithm proposed in Guzzi et. al. 2013 (*).

Developed for semantic similarity networks, this algorithm specifically targets weighted and directed graphs. This implementation adds a couple of options to the algorithm proposed in the paper, such as passing an arbitrary community detection function (e.g. python-louvain).
